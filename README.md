# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) - Simplified

## Project Description

The Decentralized Exchange (DEX) - Simplified is a blockchain-based trading platform that enables users to swap cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without intermediaries. Built on Ethereum using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, this DEX allows seamless trading between ETH and any ERC-20 token through liquidity pools managed by smart contracts.

Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, this DEX operates entirely on-chain, ensuring transparency, censorship resistance, and user custody of funds. The platform implements a constant product formula (x * y = k) similar to Uniswap, where liquidity providers earn fees from trades while users enjoy permissionless access to decentralized trading.

The simplified architecture focuses on core functionality while maintaining security and efficiency, making it an ideal starting point for understanding DeFi mechanics and AMM implementations.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize financial markets by creating an accessible, transparent, and permissionless trading infrastructure that empowers users worldwide. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Intermediaries**: Enable direct peer-to-contract trading without centralized control
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Provide global access to trading regardless of geography or background
- **Ensure Transparency**: Make all transactions and pricing mechanisms fully auditable on-chain
- **Reward Participation**: Create sustainable incentives for liquidity providers and users
- **Drive Innovation**: Serve as a foundation for advanced DeFi protocols and financial products
- **Build Trust**: Establish a secure, battle-tested platform for decentralized finance
